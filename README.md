# 3004 Final

Final exam review and practice questions for 3004.

Check out the [notes](notes.md).

Also, [some questions](questions.md) and [answers](answers.md).

.drawio files can be opened and edited with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).
Very useful for creating UML and other diagrams.

## What to Contribute

**IMPORTANT:** I want to get the notes done **before** we write questions. Please pick some sub-sub sections (the three hashtags) from [notes.md](notes.md) and fill those out as best as you can. Once everything in the notes is done, we can write questions based on the notes.

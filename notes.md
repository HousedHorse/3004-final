# COMP3004 Final Exam Notes

## Software engineering

### What is it?

- requirements analysis
- building a software system to accomplish a task
    - a software system is big and complex
    - not just a dinky little program
- reliable, modifiable process

### Why is it necessary?

- huge systems and projects difficult to manage
- we need a plan
- reliability, modifiability






## Build models

- functional model

- dynamic model

- object model

### Why do we need them?

- get an idea of full system
- requirements
- clarify details
- make sure client and design team on the same page

### What are they?

- functional model
    - FR, NFR (table, FURPS+)
    - use cases (diagrams, tables)
        - high level (don't forget the box!)
        - detailed (includes and extends)
- dynamic model
    - state machine diagrams(s)
    - activity diagram(s)
    - sequence diagram(s)
- object model
    - class diagram(s)
    - data dictionaries

### Traceability -- what and why?

- number entries in tables for traceability
    - esp. FR/NFR and data dictionary
- helps with maintenance of design








## Software development life cycle

### Phases and work products of each

1. Requirements Elicitation
    - work products? the functional model!
        - FURPS+ table
        - use case diagram
        - scenarios, use cases
1. Analysis
    - work products? the object and dynamic models!
        - class diagrams
        - activity / sequence / state machine diagrams
1. High Level System Design
    - work products?
        - system architecture
        - subsystem decomposition
1. Detailed Object Design
    - FIXME: add work products
1. Implementation
    - FIXME: add work products
1. Testing
    - FIXME: add work products
1. Deployment / Maintenance
    - FIXME: add work products

- where does the client's knowledge end and begin again?
    - ends right after analysis
    - starts up again half way through testing (once we start testing final system)

# COMP3004 Final Exam Notes

## Software engineering

### What is it?

- requirements analysis
- building a software system to accomplish a task
    - a software system is big and complex
    - not just a dinky little program
- reliable, modifiable process

### Why is it necessary?

- huge systems and projects difficult to manage
- we need a plan
- reliability, modifiability






## Build models

### Why do we need them?

### What are they?

### Traceability -- what and why?








## Software development life cycle

### Phases and work products of each

### Requirements elicitation

### Analysis

### High-level system design

### Detailed object design

### Implementation

### Testing

### Deployment and maintenance









## Models in requirements analysis

## Detailed object design

### Types of inheritance

### Liskov's principle

### Contracts







## Implementation

### Mapping objects to collections

### Model transformations

### Mapping associations to collections

### Mapping associations to storage

### Buried associations

### Association tables

### Vertical/horizontal mapping of inheritance to storage







## Testing

### Blackbox vs whitebox

### Unit testing (path, equivalence, boundary, state, polymorphism)

### Integration testing (top-down, bottom-up, sandwich, modified sandwich, test stubs, test drivers)

### System testing (functional, performance)






## Software development life cycle model
